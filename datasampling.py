'''
This script is used by Han's Desktop where he had the entire dataset stored.
The dataset was very huge (~450G) so we decided to use only a subset of all Fridays' pcap files.

This script randomly samples a specified number of PCAP files from selected days
of the CSE-CIC-IDS2018 dataset and copies into a new project directory structure.

For each listed day, it randomly selectes 50 PCAP files.
It copis the sampled PCAPs into the destination folder.
Uses a fixed random seed, 520

This script is specifically used to sample from the original dataset.
